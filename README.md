# 3D Driving Simulator

A web-based 3D driving simulator designed to enhance driver skills and road safety awareness through practical, scenario-based questions.

## Getting Started

This guide will help you set up and run the 3D driving simulator locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js and npm (or yarn). You can download them from [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/en).

### Installation

#### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://<your_github_repo_url>.git
```

#### Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd <your_project_directory>
npm install
```

#### Running the Simulator
Start the Development Server
In the project directory, run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
npx parcel ./src/index.html
```
This command will start a development server and open a browser window displaying the simulator at http://localhost:1234.

#### Open the Simulator
Click on the provided server link (http://localhost:1234) in your terminal window, or manually paste it into your browser's address bar. This will launch the 3D driving simulator application.

#### Additional Notes
The simulator is built using Parcel, a web bundler that simplifies the development process.
Changes made to the code will be automatically reflected in the browser when the development server is running.
